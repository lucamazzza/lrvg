LRVG Engine
===========

What is it?
-----------

    LRVG Engine is a graphics rendering engine written in C++. It provides core
    functionalities for 3D graphics applications, including scene graph 
    management, camera systems (perspective & orthographic), and object 
    rendering.

    The project is structured as a library (engine) and a client application
    demo, that demonstrates the engine capabilities, through a "tower of Hanoi"
    game implementation.

On what hardware does it run?
-----------------------------

    The engine has been developed in parallel on `aarch64` macOS and `x86_64`
    Microsoft Windows, so the software library is certified to run on those
    platforms.

    By using `GLFW3` and vendoring all its dependencies, the engine has very few
    prerequisites and needs, in order to be used:
    - C++20 compatible compiler (`g++` is advised)
    - Standard C++ libraries

Documentation
-------------

  There is Doxygen documentation support in the engine/ directory.
  To build the documentation, cd into engine/ and run `doxygen Doxyfile`.
  The generated HTML and LaTeX documentation will be placed in the docs/ 
  subdirectory.

  The main header file engine/engine.h contains the core API definitions.
  Additional documentation can be found in the individual header files:
   - camera.h               Camera base class
   - perspective_camera.h   Perspective projection camera
   - ortho_camera.h         Orthographic projection camera
   - node.h                 Scene graph node
   - object.h               Renderable object

Installation
------------

  To compile the engine and client application, you need to have the
  dependencies properly installed. Please read the dependencies/ directory
  for information on required libraries.

  Building is straightforward:
   - "make all" builds both the engine library and client application
   - "make build_engine" builds only the engine library
   - "make build_client" builds only the client (requires engine)
   - "make clean" removes all build artifacts

  The Makefile at the top level will invoke the appropriate makefiles in
  the engine/ and client/ subdirectories.

  For Windows users, Visual Studio project files (*.vcxproj) and Code::Blocks
  project files (*.cbp) are provided in both directories.

  The engine library version is defined in engine/common.h as LIB_VERSION.
  Debug builds will include "(debug)" in the library name string.

If something goes wrong
-----------------------

  Check that:
   - All dependencies are properly included in the dependencies/ directory
   - Your compiler supports C++20 or later
   - The Makefile paths are correct for your system

  For Windows builds, ensure the preprocessor definition ENGINE_EXPORTS is set
  when building the engine library to properly export symbols.
